Recently, I've been experimenting with the excellent R package `tidyphreeqc` [@tidyphreeqc], which provides a convenient interface for generating PHREEQC input files [@phreeqc_r; @phreeqc]. `tidyphreeqc` incorporates easily into my workflow, and it's found its way into several recent publication *CITE LI*.

I've also used it to build a separate package (`pbcusol` [@pbcusol]) that handles lead and copper solubility prediction specifically, with curated thermodynamic data and some domain specific features implemented in what is hopefully a straightforward collection of functions. `pbcusol` is implemented as a shiny app, available [here](https://bentrueman.shinyapps.io/shinypbcusol/).
