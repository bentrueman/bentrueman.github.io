    "contents": "\nRecently, I’ve been experimenting with the excellent R package tidyphreeqc (Dunnington 2019), which provides a convenient interface for generating PHREEQC input files (Charlton and Parkhurst 2011; Parkhurst and Appelo 2013). I’ve used it to build a separate package (pbcusol (Trueman 2021)) that handles lead and copper solubility prediction specifically, with curated thermodynamic data and some domain specific features implemented in what is hopefully a straightforward collection of functions.\nI’ve also implemented it in a shiny app:\n\n\n\nCharlton, S.
